# facepalm
A Facebook inspired social web app.

For my second project, I created a Single-Page Web Application clone of Facebook called Facepalm. The apps functionality is as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Users can search friends from the landing page and see the corresponding friends profile page.</li>
  <li>On each profile page you have their brief synopsis, their friends list and the latests posts from them and their friends.</li>
  <li>Each profile has full navigation functionality built in. You can view other users by clicking through the friends list, clicking a post author or their picture or by simply performing another search in the search bar.</li>
  <li>Users have the option of "Palming" (equivalent to "liking") a post. This adds the current users image to the corresponding "Palmed" post.</li>
  <li>Each profile page includes an add/remove friend button which updates the friends list of the profile page you're on as well as the current users profile.</li>
  <li>The current user is showcased in the upper right side of the navbar and you can jump to your timeline page by clicking either the image or the name. By default you are logged in as Bob Bakian.</li>
  <li>Lastly, users can view pictures of a particular user.</li>
</ul>
